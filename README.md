Novel Applications of Sensor Network Localization in Healthcare and Disaster Management}

Abstract:
Sensor network localization (SNL) is a complex problem 
involving the estimation of sensor positions based on 
distance measurements. This project investigates the 
practical applications of SNL in healthcare
and disaster management domains, focusing on evaluating
the performance of following localization algorithms: LS,
SOCP, SDP, SDP with Projection, and ADMM. We also
consider these algorithms under different noise levels
and radio ranges. Our simulations consider anchor-sensor
configurations in adult care, low-power healthcare, and
disaster management scenarios. We conclude that anchor
placement significantly impacts localization accuracy and
suggest an SDP formulation for most application scenarios.
